# Hello-World
A GitHub Tutorial

Howdy GitHubbers! (...or whatever GitHub users are called.)

I'm completely new to coding/programming/scripting. Those terms may be interchangeable for all I know, haha.

I created this GitHub account because most of the tutorials I watched were talking about Git and GitHub. I have grand dreams of wanting to code as a freelancer or even better land a sweet job. I created a Safari Books Online account and started skimming some topics and fell in love with everything that I have seen so far. I have always been a self-taught type of person, especially when it comes to computer hardware and software. I have used computers ever since I can remember. My dad bought one of them Gateway desktops back in the day from an infomercial and I started teaching myself everything I could about computers and have literally been on a computer doing something almost every day of my life since. I only wish I would've taken a look the programming side of things sooner. I always thought only geniuses could be programmers. As I've gotten older I've realized that all it takes to be a "genius" is hard work, dedication, and passion.

I am married and have 3 kids. We had our first kid when I was a junior in high school so all hopes of going to college went out the window. I immediately joined the military for the bonus and pay until I could find a better job. I finally landed a good job, but it's not exactly my passion (I sand, do body work, and prep for paint for Tiffin Motorhomes). My passion is computers and tech and always has been. I am dedicating what little free time I have from here on out to learning as much as I can about coding until I can get proficient enough and confident enough to start doing it for money. 

I have read that to get a job in this field, employers would rather see work that you have done instead of a degree. That fits me perfectly because I can learn to do the work and am willing to spend nearly all of my time working on something that I enjoy doing.

I am looking back at what I have written so far and I realize that nobody is probably even gonna read this or would want to read my whole life story, haha. 

Anyways I hope that this is the beginning of a long, satisfying, never-ending learning experience.
